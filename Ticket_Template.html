                            <p>In order to ensure a fair and transparent allocation of Tickets, the procedure for Ticket
                                allocation for the 2018 FIFA World Cup RussiaTM has been divided into three phases. The
                                dates given below are all subject to possible change without prior notice which will be
                                communicated on www.FIFA.com/tickets.</p>
                            <p>
                                The first Tickets for the 2018 FIFA World Cup RussiaTM went on sale on 14th September
                                2017.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sales Phase (1) was divided into two Sales Periods. First, fans were able to request
                                Tickets on a Random Selection Draw basis (from 14th September 2017 until 12th October
                                2017), and then after the Random Selection Draw has taken place and the successful
                                Ticket Applications were determined, they were able to purchase the remaining Tickets on
                                a First Come First Served basis from 16th November 2017 to 28th November 2017. During
                                Sales Phase (1), fans were able to buy Tickets based on the date and venue of a Match
                                (teams playing were determined later), or to follow a specific team (date and venue
                                determined later). This is because during Sales Phase (1) it was not yet determined
                                where specific teams were playing any given Match, with the exception of Russia as Team
                                A1.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sales Phase (2) commenced after the Final Draw when football fans found out where all
                                participating teams would be playing. Sales Phase (2) is also divided into two Sales
                                Periods. The first Sales Period of Sales Phase (2) was again a Ticket Application
                                collection period with applications submitted from 5th December 2017 until 31st January
                                2018. Random Selection Draws took place in order to determine which Ticket Applications
                                were successful. The remaining Tickets were available from 13th March 2018 to 3rd April
                                2018 on a First Come First Served basis, where Ticket purchases were processed as a
                                real-time transaction, which means the Tickets were confirmed at the point of purchase.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the Last Minute Sales Phase from 18th April 2018 up until the final Match day of the
                                Competition, the remaining Tickets will be available to all customers online and, from
                                1st May, 2018 (subject to change) until the final Match day of the competition,
                                remaining Tickets will also be available Over the Counter at the designated FIFA Venue
                                Ticketing Centres. During the Last Minute Sales Phase, Ticket purchases are processed as
                                a real-time transaction to the extent inventory remains available. </p>
